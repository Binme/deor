	        	'text_4_1'=>'The program’s success is chiefly attributed to the enthusiasm and excitement of its tour guides – volunteer university students from institutions across Da Nang – and the diversity of the tourist sites customers are introduced to during the ninety-minute tour, including Han Market, Da Nang Cathedral, the Cham Sculpture Museum, and the Han River Bridge.',
